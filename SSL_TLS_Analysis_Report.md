# SSL/TLS Analysis Report

**Target:** sifaris.walingmun.gov.np (IP: 103.69.125.174)
**Assessment Date:** Sun, 25 May 2025 07:35:06 UTC

## Summary

The SSL/TLS assessment of the server revealed the following key points:

* Server supports TLS versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3.
* Strong cipher suites are used in TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.
* Legacy cipher suites including 3DES (vulnerable to SWEET32 attack) are still enabled in TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2.
* The server uses an RSA 2048-bit certificate issued by the `R10` issuer.
* Certificate is valid from 22 May 2025 until 20 August 2025.
* No extended validation (EV) certificate is used.
* Certificate chain is trusted with no chain issues.
* Minor warnings related to older protocols and legacy cipher suites were detected.

## Detailed Findings

### Nmap SSL/TLS Cipher Enumeration

**Port:** 443/tcp (HTTPS)
**Host latency:** 0.0084s

* **TLS 1.1:**

  * Supports AES 128/256 CBC with ECDHE\_RSA and RSA key exchange (Grade A).
  * Includes TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_3DES\_EDE\_CBC\_SHA (Grade C), vulnerable to SWEET32 attack.
  * Server cipher preference enabled.
  * Warning: 64-bit block cipher 3DES is vulnerable to SWEET32 attack.

* **TLS 1.2:**

  * Supports strong ciphers with AES GCM and CBC modes with ECDHE\_RSA, DHE\_RSA, and RSA.
  * Includes TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_3DES\_EDE\_CBC\_SHA (Grade C).
  * Server cipher preference enabled.
  * Warning: 64-bit block cipher 3DES vulnerable to SWEET32.

* **TLS 1.3:**

  * Supports AES 128/256 GCM (Grade A).
  * Server cipher preference enabled.
  * Least strength detected: Grade C (due to legacy ciphers).

### SSL Certificate Details

* **Certificate Subject:** sifaris.walingmun.gov.np
* **Issuer:** R10
* **Key:** RSA 2048 bits (e=65537)
* **Signature Algorithm:** SHA256withRSA
* **Serial Number:** 05b87f1e3f0b44ffe14ba6418983217940ea
* **Validity:** 22 May 2025 â€“ 20 Aug 2025 (approx. 3 months)
* **Revocation Status:** Good (not revoked)
* **Certificate Chain:**

  * Server cert signed by R10
  * R10 signed by ISRG Root X1 (trusted root)

### Known Issues & Recommendations

* **Legacy Protocols:** TLS 1.1 is deprecated and should be disabled. Focus on TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 only.
* **Weak Ciphers:** Remove 3DES cipher suites to prevent SWEET32 attack exposure.
* **Certificate Expiry:** Certificate expires in under 3 months; plan timely renewal.
* **Server Cipher Preference Error:** Investigate and fix network error related to cipher preference configuration.
* **Protocol Support:** Ensure no draft or insecure TLS versions are enabled.

## Conclusion

The server's SSL/TLS configuration is generally secure with strong modern cipher suites and a trusted certificate chain. However, legacy support for weak ciphers and outdated protocols creates vulnerabilities that should be addressed promptly to improve security posture.
